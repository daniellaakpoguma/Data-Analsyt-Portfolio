A. Customer Journey
Based off the 8 sample customers provided in the sample from the subscriptions table, write a brief description about each customerâ€™s onboarding journey.
Try to keep it as short as possible - you may also want to run some sort of join to make your explanations a bit easier!

B. Data Analysis Questions
1. How many customers has Foodie-Fi ever had?
``` sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(customer_id)) AS no_customers
FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions;
```
2. What is the monthly distribution of trial plan start_date values for our dataset - use the start of the month as the group by value
``` sql
SELECT DATE_TRUNC('month',start_date) AS month, COUNT(*)
FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions
GROUP BY month
ORDER BY month;
```
3. What plan start_date values occur after the year 2020 for our dataset? Show the breakdown by count of events for each plan_name
``` sql
SELECT plan_name, COUNT(*)
FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions AS s
JOIN foodie_fi.plans AS p
ON s.plan_id = p.plan_id
WHERE DATE_TRUNC('year',start_date) > '2020-01-01'
GROUP BY plan_name;
```

4. What is the customer count and percentage of customers who have churned rounded to 1 decimal place?
``` sql
SELECT plan_name, (COUNT(DISTINCT(customer_id) * 1.0)/customer_count) AS churn_percent
FROM foodie_fi.plans AS p
JOIN (
  SELECT plan_id, customer_id, COUNT(DISTINCT(customer_id)) AS customer_count           FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions 
  GROUP BY plan_id, customer_id
  ) AS c
ON s.plan_id = p.plan_id
JOIN foodie_fi.subscriptions AS s 
ON s.plan_id = p.plan_id
WHERE plan_name = 'churn'
GROUP BY plan_name, c.customer_count;

SELECT 
    p.plan_name, 
    (COUNT(DISTINCT s.customer_id) * 1.0) / total_customers.total_count AS churn_percent
FROM 
    foodie_fi.plans AS p
JOIN foodie_fi.subscriptions AS s ON s.plan_id = p.plan_id
JOIN (
    SELECT 
        COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS total_count
    FROM 
        foodie_fi.subscriptions
) AS total_customers ON 1=1
WHERE 
    p.plan_name = 'churn'
GROUP BY 
    p.plan_name, total_customers.total_count;
```

6. What is the number and percentage of customer plans after their initial free trial?
7. What is the customer count and percentage breakdown of all 5 plan_name values at 2020-12-31?
8. How many customers have upgraded to an annual plan in 2020?
9. How many days on average does it take for a customer to an annual plan from the day they join Foodie-Fi?
